    "text_content": "Priya Sharma (Mother of 2, Mumbai): My 5-year-old daughter loves stories, but she always asks 'Why can't I be the princess?' The generic books just don't connect with her the way I wish they would.\n\nRajesh Kumar (Father, Bangalore): Exactly! My son sees all these Western characters and asks why none of them look like him. Representation matters, even in children's books.\n\nMeera Joshi (Researcher): What would make the perfect children's book for you?\n\nPriya: Something where my child is actually IN the story. Not just a character that looks similar, but genuinely personalized with their name, their face, their interests.\n\nAnita Patel (Grandmother, Delhi): And it should teach something valuable! These days, children learn from screens more than books. If we're going to compete with tablets, books need to be special.\n\nVikram Singh (Tech Professional): I'd pay premium for that. My daughter gets so many generic books as gifts. Something truly personalized would stand out.\n\nKavya Nair (Teacher & Parent): The educational aspect is crucial. I see so many beautiful books that are just pretty pictures. What if each story taught patience, or courage, or kindness?\n\nArjun Reddy (Creative Director): The artwork matters too. Disney style is overplayed. Something more artistic, maybe like Studio Ghibli - that dreamy, magical quality.\n\nDeepak Gupta (Single Father): Convenience is key for busy parents. If I could upload a photo and get a personalized book delivered, that's gold. Especially for gifts to relatives.\n\nMeera: How much would you pay for such a product?\n\nPriya: For a digital version? Maybe ₹300-500. For a physical book that's truly personalized? ₹1000-2000 easily.\n\nRajesh: More for special occasions. For my daughter's birthday, I'd spend ₹3000-4000 on something this unique.\n\nAnita: Grandparents would love this! We always struggle to find meaningful gifts. A personalized storybook would be perfect.\n\nVikram: The key is quality. If it looks amateur or cheap, it defeats the purpose. It needs to look professional, like a real published book.\n\nKavya: And age-appropriate content. Parents need to trust that AI-generated content is safe and educational for their children.\n\nArjun: Multiple formats would be great - digital for instant gratification, physical for the full experience, maybe even framed art prints.\n\nDeepak: Speed matters too. If my niece's birthday is next week, I can't wait a month for delivery.\n\nMeera: Any concerns about AI-generated content?\n\nPriya: Safety is paramount. As long as the content is reviewed and appropriate, AI could create stories I could never imagine.\n\nRajesh: The personalization potential is incredible. Imagine if it could incorporate my child's actual interests - if he loves dinosaurs, the story could include that.\n\nAnita: Just ensure it's not replacing human creativity entirely. The warmth and love should still come through.",
